# RPCS3-game-not-working-correctly-with-game-world-and-textures-all-rendered-mainly-in-shades-of-blue-
Hi, after much research it seems a smaller number of the games on RPCS3 ps3 emulator such as the "disney pixar WALL-E" game run however the animated world and object textures  are rendered in only different shades of blue mainly clearly a bug of some sort though the game seems to run fine and the graphics are working but everything is tinted shades of blue...but since i dont have a way to test this myself to see if its been fixed since then like one person claims, basically i was hoping someone could test the ps3 version of the WALL-E game using a ps3 emulator on their pc, to see if the issue has been resolved and to send either screenshots or videos of the game whether it works correctly or not...i also hope if this is possible that you make a youtube test video of this game on a emulator like rpcs3 on a pc computer. I cant test this for myself at the moment as i only have a tablet to use for now since my old computer is out of the question... also if you want to see what im taking about with the walle ps3 game issues with the color bug go look up wall-e world and textures rendered in blue and you will find multiple reports of this blue tinted screen color bug. Any help, testing or knowledge would be greatly appreciated üòÅ
